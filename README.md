## Quick and Dirty Fork n' Pull Tutorial

Today you're going to contribute to my repo using the fork and pull workflow.

Here are the following steps.
Please reference the [GitHub Teamwork Toolkit](https://github.com/Emiton/GitHub-Teamwork-Toolkit) if you need help.

Fork my repo
Make your own local copy
Checkout a feature branch
Make a .txt file and tell me a little about yourself.
Or you can make a .md file if you are comfortable with Markdown. Get creative! (or weird) :alien:  
Make a PR

The steps above are purposely lacking. Please reference the Toolkit mentioned above if you have any questions.
